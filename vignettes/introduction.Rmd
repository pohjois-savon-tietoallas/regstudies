```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

Install and load necessary libraries for this example

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(regstudies) 
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
```


## Example dataset

The regstudies package provides useful tools for modifying and filtering the register data sets. Typically in register studies the data consists of events, which are stored in data as time stamps. In our example dataset the time stamps are date of hospital visits. Also, in register studies the data are commonly studied with respect to index date, which is a date of interest that can vary by individuals.

Our example data is simulated data that represents a postal questionnaire survey study which has been extended to register data. There are two data sets, the `sample_cohort` is holding the study group, and `sample_regdata` holds the hospital visits for the study group members.

More precisely, the `sample_cohort` lists the individual id study numbers as `id` for whom the register data has been collected. It also list the `postingdate` holding the date of submitting the postal questionnaire.

The `sample_regdata` contains also variable `id` which is necessary to be able to link the data sets. The `sample_regdata` also contains variables holding the diagnosis codes at `CODE1` and times of hospital admission `adm_date` and hospital discharge `disc_date`.


```{r}
summary(sample_cohort)
```

Dataset `sample_regdata` is a dataset which has events for the selected population with ICD codes and date-variables:

```{r}
summary(sample_regdata)
```


## Preparation for classifications

We use two sample datasets `sample_regdata` and `sample_cohort`, which are included in the package.  Joining these two datasets we got a full dataset ready for analyzes:

```{r}
# Join register data with population cohort data
d <- sample_regdata %>%
  left_join(sample_cohort)

head(d)
```

Classification need help variable, which tells us which version of ICD-codes we are using:

```{r}
## create a new help variable `icd` which determines if code is ICD-8, ICD-9 or ICD-10 by year
d <- d %>% 
  mutate(icd = case_when(
    year(disc_date) < 1987 ~ "icd8",
    year(disc_date) < 1996 & year(disc_date)>=1987 ~ "icd9",
    year(disc_date) >= 1996 ~ "icd10"
    ))
```


## Elixhauser

With function `classify_elixhauser()` and `sum_score()` you can use Elixhauser classification and calculate scores. Check more info of classifications from [classification tables](docs/articles/classification_tables.html)-section.

```{r}
regstudies:::elixhauser_classes
```


```{r}
d %>% 
  # filter(icd == "icd10") %>% 
  classify_elixhauser(icd_codes = CODE1) 
```

*When using function argument `verbose = TRUE`, message "Element 'regex.rm' NOT in use. Exceptions omitted." is normal when ........ * 

To calculate elixhauser scores for each individual you just need to add `sum_score` function. The premade classification table contains two alternative scores to be used `score_AHRQ` and `score_van_Walraven` both of which can be calculated at one function call.

```{r}
# Calculate scores
d %>% 
  classify_elixhauser(icd_codes = CODE1) %>% 
  sum_score(score_AHRQ, score_van_Walraven)
```

Function classifies all the rows which has classification code in `regstudies:::elixhauser_classes`. If the is no classification on certain ICD code, row will get NA values.




*Historgram of sums.....*

## Charlson comorbidity

Classifying Charlson comorbidity classes give as output long formatted data as wel Elixhauser classification:

```{r}
## Classifying Charlson comorbidity classes to long format
charlson <- d %>% 
  classify_charlson(CODE1) 
head(charlson)
```

## Long data to wide data

For example in modelling you might want to have dataset in wide format. To modify dataset to wide format, use `dplyr::pivot_wider()` verb:

```{r}
charlson %>%
  mutate(class_charlson=paste0("cl_",class_charlson)) %>% # TODO: laita tämä ominaisuus classify-funktioon sisälle!
  mutate(score_charlson=as.integer(score_charlson>0)) %>% 
  tidyr::pivot_wider(names_from="class_charlson",
                     values_from="score_charlson",
                     values_fill=0) %>%
  select(-all_of(c("cl_NA","label_charlson"))) -> charlson_wide
head(charlson_wide)
```

## Extra: labeling wide data

You can also add labels to variables in wide format data with code below

```{r}
## calculating labels
regstudies:::charlson_classes %>%
  select(class_charlson,label_charlson) %>%
  mutate(class_charlson=paste0("cl_",class_charlson)) -> labels

# setting up the labels for wide data
for(i in 1:dim(labels)[1]) {
  l <- labels$class_charlson[i]
  if(!is.null(charlson_wide[[l]])) {
    attr(charlson_wide[[l]], "label") <- labels$label_charlson[i]
  }
}
```
